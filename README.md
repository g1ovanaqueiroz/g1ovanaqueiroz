### 🛡️ I'm a Guardian
Guardians@UFCG is a group formed by computer science students focused on the dissemination of knowledge in sysadmin, devops and related.

### 🦾 I'm a volunteer at RAS IEEE UFCG
You probably know the IEEE. RAS (Robotics & Automation Society) is an IEEE branch that seeks to research and disseminate knowledge about robotics worldwide, in addition to participating in competitions of programming and robotics.

### 🎶 Fun fact
I love and have been studying music since I was a kid, so you will probably see some personal music projects around here.
