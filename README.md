## Hello world, my name is Giovana 👋🏼

I'm a computer science student at UFCG. I love functional programming, web development and music.

### 🛡️ I'm a Guardian
Guardians@UFCG is a group formed by computer science students focused on dissemination of knowledge in sysadmin, devops and related.
And I have been researching these topics and hosting the Guardians podcast [#ChamaOSuporte](https://anchor.fm/chamaosuporte).
 
### 🦾 I'm a volunteer at [RAS IEEE UFCG](https://github.com/ras-ufcg)
You probably know IEEE. RAS (Robotics & Automation Society) is an IEEE branch that seeks to research and disseminate knowledge on robotics worldwide, in addition to participating in competitions of programming and robotics.

### 🎶 Fun fact...
I love music and have been studying it since I was a kid, so you will probably see some personal music projects around here.
